# Snake-LadderGame

Objective: You have to design a simple Snakes & Ladders game.

Assumptions:
Assume that only 1 player is playing the game.
Assume that the game has 4 snakes and 4 ladders of varying lengths dispersed on the board.
You can choose to initialize / define where these snakes and ladders will be on the board and how long each of them
are. For e.g, a ladder could be at cell 07 and it could take you ahead to 33. Or a snake could be at 87 and bring you
back to 32. It's your choice.

Input and Output:
The input to your program will be any number between 1 to 6 (...the numbers on a dice...), and your current position.
The output of your program will be your new position.
